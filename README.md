# System_Of_Equations_Solver
This MATLAB code was written for a Computational Analysis class. See Math330_Homework3.pdf for details. The problems were based on using MATLAB to numerically solve systems of linear equations.

This MATLAB code was written for a Computational Analysis class for homework problems. See Math330_Homework3.pdf for details. The first question involved solving a system of equations in MATLAB and computing the residuals. The second question involved solving systems of equations in MATLAB using two different algorithms: Gaussian Elimination and Conjugate Gradient, in which their results and execution time are compared. The third question involves solving for the vector of coefficients for a linear system of equations. Lastly, the fourth question involves finding a vector of coefficients for a Fourier Series to create a model that matches population data.
